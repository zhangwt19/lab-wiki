# Set up RStudio server  

This tutorial will help you to set up rstudio server. With rstudio server, you will use the R installed on the server and have access to all the files on the server. (I recommended you use `conda` to manage your environment and install your own R with `conda`).

* On **polaris**, do the following.

```
# create a screen
screen

# Pull down the Singularity image
singularity pull --name rstudio.simg docker://rocker/tidyverse:latest

# Create the local filesystem
TMPDIR=$HOME/rstudio-tmp
mkdir -p $TMPDIR/tmp/rstudio-server
mkdir -p $TMPDIR/var/{lib,run}
uuidgen > $TMPDIR/tmp/rstudio-server/secure-cookie-key
chmod 600 $TMPDIR/tmp/rstudio-server/secure-cookie-key

# Run the container
PASSWORD='aaa' singularity exec \
--bind $TMPDIR/var/lib:/var/lib/rstudio-server \
--bind $TMPDIR/var/run:/var/run/rstudio-server \
--bind $TMPDIR/tmp:/tmp \
--bind /dartfs/rc/lab/S/Szhao \
rstudio.simg \
rserver \
--auth-none=0 \
--auth-pam-helper-path=pam-helper \
--www-address=127.0.0.1 \
--www-port=8789 \
--server-user $USER

# detach from the screen
# press ctrl + A + D
```

Note if this port is being used, change the port number. and of course you need to change the port number in the following commands too.

* On my local computer/laptop, do the following: 

  be sure to change user ID and port number accordingly.

```
# Create the SSH tunnel
ssh -N -f -L 8789:localhost:8789 d92495j@polaris.dartmouth.edu

http://localhost:8789
# log in as d92495j and password is aaa
```

# Set up RStudio server using Conda environment
* open up a terminal window, log in **Polaris**

make a directory within the home directory
```
$ mkdir singularity_imgs
```
print working diretory
```
$ pwd 
```
```
/dartfs-hpc/rc/home/k/f******/singularity_images
```

* open another terminal window, log in **Discovery7**
```
ssh f*****@discovery7.hpcc.dartmouth.edu
```
If prompt asks **‘Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?**

Type 
```
> yes
```

Copy the rstudio.simg file from scratch space to your newly made directory
```
$ cp /scratch/rstudio/rstudio.simg /dartfs-hpc/rc/home/k/f******/singularity_images
```

Go back to the **Polaris** terminal window, type
```
singularity exec \
--bind /dartfs-hpc/rc/home/k/f******/.conda/envs/r_env \
--bind $(pwd)  /dartfs-hpc/rc/home/k/f******/singularity_images/rstudio.simg rserver \
--www-address=127.0.0.1 \
--www-port **** \
--rsession-which-r=/dartfs-hpc/rc/home/k/f******/.conda/envs/r_env/bin/R \
--rsession-ld-library-path=/dartfs-hpc/rc/home/k/f******/.conda/envs/r_env/lib \
--server-user $USER
```
Be sure to change the working directory paths to your own and change the port number!

* open the third terminal window, type
```
 % ssh -N -f -L ****:localhost:**** f******@polaris.dartmouth.edu
```
then type your password

* open up a browser, type
```
localhost:****
```
You are now able to use your Rstudio server within a conda environment.
 
* On your RStudio Server console, type
```
.libPaths("/dartfs-hpc/rc/home/k/f******/.conda/envs/r_env/lib")
```
then type this to check and see you’re connected to the correct path.
```
.libPaths()
```
* **Remember, try to install packages using terminal**
```
$ conda activate ‘your env’
```
**Try not to install through Rstudio server, Rstudio server is a bit strange when it comes to installing packages.**
